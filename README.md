### **Overview**
This repository contains a **Python-based Jupyter Notebook** explaining the fundamental concepts of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** with examples. The content is inspired by Welch Labs' educational series (see References) and aims to provide an intuitive understanding of ANN architecture, forward propagation, and learning mechanisms.

The repository includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) implementing ANN concepts with practical examples.
- Detailed explanations with illustrative diagrams and code snippets.
- The notebook is in Spanish; however, an English version is in the works.

### **Background**
**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They have been widely used in various applications such as:
- **Image classification**
- **Natural language processing (NLP)**
- **Predictive modeling and forecasting**

This notebook focuses on a **supervised learning regression problem**, where the objective is to predict a student's test score based on the number of hours spent sleeping and studying.

Key topics covered:
- **Neural network architecture**
- **Forward propagation mechanism**
- **Matrix operations for optimization**
- **Activation functions** (e.g., sigmoid function)
- **Gradient Descent**
- **Numerical Gradient Testing**
- **Training using Quasi-Newton (BFGS) optimization method**
- **Overfitting**

### **How to Run the Notebook**
1. Install **Python 3.7+** and Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy notebook
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/andreaf-campos/ANN-FromScratch.git
   cd ANN-FromScratch
   ```
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Redes_Neuronales_Artificiales_ANN.ipynb
   ```
5. Run the notebook cells to explore ANN concepts interactively.
